# Internship

Contribution in the project:
1. Complete model of RRR robotic manipulator, including simulations that demonstrates
   the behavior of required trajectory.
2. Detailed description of friction model used for the incorporation of joint friction.
3. Underlying theory of the motor selection and sizing and how to incorporate and
   implement in ADMAS model for simulation purpose.
